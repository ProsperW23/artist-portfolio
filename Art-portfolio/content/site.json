I’m interested in the moment an artwork stops performing and becomes present — when the viewer leans in, not because it shouts, but because it refuses noise."

    "about_text": "My practice is editorial: each piece is composed with the discipline of print. I treat whitespace as material and hierarchy as a form of respect. Whether a cover illustration or a conceptual plate, the goal is the same: to create a quiet object of attention — museum-grade, unhurried, exact."
