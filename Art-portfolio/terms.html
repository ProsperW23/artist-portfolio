      <h2>1. Scope of Work</h2>
      <p>All commissions begin with a written scope: deliverables, intended usage, timeline, and final output formats. Any request outside the agreed scope will be treated as a change request and may affect pricing and schedule.</p>

      <h2>2. Licensing & Usage Rights</h2>
      <p>Unless explicitly stated otherwise, commissions are licensed — not sold. The default license grants the client permission to use the final delivered artwork for the specific project and usage described in writing (for example: a book cover, a campaign post, or a single edition print).</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exclusive licenses</strong> (preventing the artist from re-licensing) require additional fees and must be agreed in writing.</li>
        <li><strong>Buyouts / full assignment</strong> (transfer of copyright) are available only in special cases and are priced significantly higher.</li>
        <li>Any usage not disclosed at the inquiry stage (e.g., merchandise, mass advertising, reselling, NFT minting) is not included and requires a revised license.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Credit & Attribution</h2>
      <p>Where reasonable, the client agrees to credit the artist as “Artwork by Ebele Nwosu” (or the agreed credit line). Editorial and publishing contexts typically include credit on the imprint page, acknowledgements, or campaign credits.</p>

      <h2>4. Payments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Standard payment terms are <strong>60% upfront</strong> to begin work and <strong>40% before final delivery</strong>.</li>
        <li>For larger projects, staged milestones may be used.</li>
        <li>Invoices are payable in Nigerian Naira (₦) unless otherwise agreed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Revisions</h2>
      <p>Commissions include <strong>two revision rounds</strong> after the initial concept direction is approved. Revisions are defined as adjustments to an agreed direction (color, minor composition changes, typographic placement notes). A request that changes the direction entirely is treated as a new concept and billed accordingly.</p>

      <h2>6. Refunds & Cancellations</h2>
      <p>Because commissions reserve calendar time and begin as custom work, upfront payments are generally non-refundable once work starts. If a project is cancelled early, the artist may refund any unused portion at their discretion, minus time already spent. Any delivered concepts or drafts remain the artist’s property unless fully paid and licensed.</p>

      <h2>7. Delivery Formats</h2>
      <p>Deliverables are supplied in the formats agreed in writing. Typical deliveries include high-resolution JPG/PNG, print-ready PDF, and/or layered PSD. Source files are not automatically included unless stated in the scope.</p>

      <h2>8. Turnaround Times</h2>
      <p>Estimated timelines are provided per commission type. Delivery dates assume timely client responses. Delays in feedback may shift schedules without penalty to the artist.</p>

      <h2>9. Archiving & Portfolio Use</h2>
      <p>Unless a confidentiality clause is signed, the artist may display the work (including excerpts) in their portfolio and social channels after public release. For embargoed projects, the display can be delayed until launch.</p>


      <h2>10. Communication</h2>
      <p>Primary communication is via email or the contact form. Clear written decisions protect both parties. Urgent deadlines require advance notice and may incur rush fees.</p>
